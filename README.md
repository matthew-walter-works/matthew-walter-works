👋 who am i?

I'm Matt Walter — an engineering leader, platform architect, and developer experience champion with over 15 years of experience scaling delivery systems and infrastructure. I love building tools that make developers faster, safer, and happier.

From bootstrapping cloud-native platforms at startups to leading globally distributed teams at Fortune 500 companies, I’ve spent my career removing friction from software delivery and empowering engineers to do their best work.

🛠️ what do i do?

Right now, I’m partnering with teams through **Solid Endeavor**, helping them level up their infrastructure, automation, and security. Previously, I was Head of Infrastructure at Equilibrium Energy, where I led a platform team focused on scalable, secure Kubernetes environments across AWS.

Before that, I held principal engineering and management roles at Vimeo, CVS, and Aetna, delivering solutions in CI/CD, developer security, observability, and data platforms.

🌍 tech i love

- **Cloud & Infra**: AWS, GCP, Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker
- **DevEx & Delivery**: GitOps (ArgoCD, Kustomize), GitHub Actions and Gitlab CI/CD
- **Security & Compliance**: OPA, Kyverno, Checkmarx, BurpSuite
- **Languages**: Golang, Python, JavaScript/Node.js, TypeScript, C#
- **Philosophy**: Shift-left everything. Automate the painful stuff. Build for the humans behind the code.

💬 how i work

I lead with empathy, obsess over developer experience, and believe great platforms should feel invisible until you need them. I’ve built multi-tenant platforms, designed DDD-aligned service frameworks, and implemented GitOps pipelines that actually stick.

Whether mentoring engineers, shaping strategy, or writing Terraform, I aim to be the kind of teammate who makes your day a little better.

✨ outside the code

When I’m not behind a keyboard, I’m likely doing something outdoors: fly fishing, rowing, cycling (I once crossed the U.S. self-supported), or camping with my family. I’ve also been an EMT, speak conversational French, and love the quiet rhythm of a morning yoga session.

🧭 if you're building something fun / big and or ambitious and want a steady hand on platform or delivery, let's talk.
